# fashion mnist zoo
 This project contains implementations of some PyTorch models and code for training and evaluating them.

## Dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:  

0. T-shirt/top
1. Trouser
2. Pullover
3. Dress
4. Coat
5. Sandal
6. Shirt
7. Sneaker
8. Bag
9. Ankle boot

## Models to be implemented:
- [x] CNN
- [x] feed-forward network
- [x] multi-class perceptron
- [ ] GAN
- [ ] Encoder + some model
- [ ] Many more

## Results
